This repository is not a programming project itself, rather I use some mlx codes in order to generate graphics and math equations which later will be written in using latex and word and will be exported to a final pdf file. There are a total number of 6 pdf files containing 3 microeconomics questions and 3 answers each.

Enjoy it
